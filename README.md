# Zero to Production in Rust

## In the Beginning...

After setting up with cargo, we can 

```bash
cargo install cargo-watch
cargo watch -x check
# OR
cargo watch -x check -x test -x run
```

This runs cargo check after every code change.
The latter command is a chain of commands, to check, test, and run.
The commands stop if the chain breaks. 
This is the _inner development loop_.

To measure code coverage:

```bash
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
cargo tarpaulin --ignore-tests
```

The latter will measure the test coverage and ignore the tests themselves, which makes sense.
Further, one will check linting and formatting with the following:

```bash
rustup component add clippy
cargo clippy -- -D warnings # fails a pipeline on warnings

rustup component add rustfmt
cargo fmt -- -check
```

It's possible to configure Clippy inline or in a `clippy.toml` file.
Rust formatter can also be configured with a `rustfmt.toml` file as well. 
And if security is a concern:

```bash
cargo install cargo-audit
cargo audit
```

It's a package maintained by The Rust SecureCode working group.
It checks if any of the crates in your dependency tree have reported vulnerabilities.

## Email Newletter Starter Notes

Might be worth noting this is a basic project, and users wont be given ability to _unsubscribe_.
So do not put into production without critical features such as that.
